# hydra_tutorial
Personal tutorial for python library [hydra](hydra.cc).

Hydra is a large package which needs time to get used to. You can go to [tutorial/](tutorial/) to figure out:
- how to use hydra
- figure out different ways to perform the same thing (and hopefully settle down to your favorite way)
- different ways to make errors
- etc...

There are more guidelines in the [tutorial/README.md](tutorial/README.md)

If you want to use hydra right away, there's [template/](template/) which you could use as a baseline structure for your experiment.

Feel free to email me about hydra, or improvements on the tutorial. Good luck! \

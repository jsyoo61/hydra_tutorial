# Template

Backbone for coding with hydra.

- `development.ipynb`: For development. Load config code interactively.
- `run.py`: For command line execution. Leverages hydra's functionalities (logging, multirun, etc)

(The file structures are almost identical to [tutorial/simple](../tutorial/simple/), with some modifications.)
